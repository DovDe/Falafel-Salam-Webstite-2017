# Falafel-Salam-Webstite-2017

Falafel Salam is a local business that makes organic farm-to-table Middle Eastern cuisine.They do food truck locations as well as farmers markets and festivals.  <br>
This page will need to display falafel Salam’s Current locations (there are often more than one) as well as their future destinations. The Idea is to populate a carousel with the data from the businesses Google calendar.<br>
The page will automatically show the current days schedule for each location the page will display an expandable image,an embedded Google map to the location, and information about the time and address the truck (or booth) will be open for business.The user will be able to slide through the carousel of days to find where FS will be on any given day.I will only be creating this one page so for now I will not need to worry about the rest of the navigation. <br>


For now I plan on using these external resources:<br>
1.	Jquery <br>
2.	Bootstrap <br>
3.	Google calander API <br>
4.	Google Maps API <br>

I will most likely be using Helvetica as my font. The major colors I will be using are green, black, and white.<br>
I may also be using purple and some sort of wood color.<br>
I have not fully decided on the graphical elements yet I am looking for elements that will give the business a clean,<br>
neat and modern look while adhering to the company’s organic, farm-farm-to-table ideology and product. <br>
